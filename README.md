Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
(Answer) Finally, the 11th hour I managed to crack this egg. Achieved all my requirements.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
(Answer) No. But the final result you see before you didn't come without pain and suffering.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
(Answer) I found every aspect of this assignment difficult.

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

(Answer) Where to start? Whether it was forgetting to use the word const on one occasion (took me an hour to pin-point), or a capital letter breaking up the code here and there. Forgetting to link up the stylesheet. Changing the urls at the very end (in place of localhost 4242) to the CLIENT! Rather than the SERVER! (school boy error). Long story short, this was painful. But I got there in the end! And also made it look pretty. I'm happy with the outcome in the end. But nobody but myself will know how hard this was!
